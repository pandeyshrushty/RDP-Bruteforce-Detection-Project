**RDP Brute Force Detection Project

(Windows 10 + Parrot OS + Event Logs)**

This project demonstrates how failed Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) login attempts can be detected using Windows Event Logs.
A controlled brute-force attack was generated using Hydra from Parrot OS, and the resulting failed login logs (Event ID 4625) were collected and analyzed.

🚀 Objective

Perform a brute-force attack on a Windows 10 machine using Hydra

Generate multiple failed RDP login attempts

Detect these attempts in Windows Security Logs

Document attack behavior and indicators

Demonstrate SOC-style investigation

🖥 Lab Setup
Target Machine

OS: Windows 10

IP: 192.168.80.134

RDP Enabled

Username used: FunnyPhisher

Weak lab password: Test@123 (for testing only)

Attacker Machine

OS: Parrot Security OS

Tool used: Hydra

🔥 Attack Execution (Hydra Command)
hydra -l FunnyPhisher -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -t 1 rdp://192.168.80.134

Breakdown:
Option	Meaning
-l	username
-P	password list
-t 1	only 1 thread → RDP stable
rdp://IP	attack on RDP service

Password list used:

/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

📁 Windows Security Logs (Event ID 4625)

After hydra brute-force, Windows logs show:

🔹 Event ID: 4625 (Failed Login)

Each failed login contains:

Account Name

Source IP (Attacker IP)

Failure Reason

Time

Event Viewer Path:

Event Viewer →
Windows Logs →
Security →
Filter by Event ID = 4625

📊 Sample Log Entry (4625)
An account failed to log on.
Account Name: FunnyPhisher
Failure Reason: Unknown user name or bad password
Logon Type: 10 (Remote/ RDP)
Source Network Address: 192.168.80.1
Event ID: 4625


(Tum apne system ka log yaha paste kar dena — maine placeholder diya hai)

📌 Indicators of Attack
Indicator	Value
Multiple failed logins	Yes
Logon Type	10 (RDP)
Username	FunnyPhisher
Attacker IP	Parrot OS ka IP
Password Attempts	From rockyou.txt
🛡 How to Detect RDP Brute Force
🔹 Check Windows Logs:
Security Logs → Event ID 4625

🔹 Check for patterns:

Same username

Many attempts in seconds

Logon Type = 10

Unknown/Bad password
